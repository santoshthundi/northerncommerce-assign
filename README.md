Here I am presenting some quick project work which I have done in 
- Terraform
- Containerization of Python code (Dockerfile code)
- AWS CLI (Demonstrating Shell skills)
- Ansible playbook for Nginx installation

Individual README in all the folders/project contains the instruction to use and the purpose of code.
